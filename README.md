# Portfolio

I needed a site where I could compile my projects, show them in detail in a single source and share them, and also show my social accounts in a single source and use them for "Networking" works, so I compiled all my social accounts and projects, as most Web developers do, and at the same time I know languages. and I decided to create a Portfolio site where I share some information about myself so I developed this Web site.
